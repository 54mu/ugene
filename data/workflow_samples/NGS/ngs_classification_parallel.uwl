#@UGENE_WORKFLOW
#The workflow takes FASTQ files with metagenomic NGS reads as input and process them as follows:
# * Pre-processing:
#   - Filter the reads by the CASAVA header (for Illumina platform).
#   - Cut the adapter sequences.
#   - Trim reads ends by quality.
#   - Provide FastQC reads quality report.
# * Classification:
#   - Classify the pre-processed reads with Kraken.
#   - Classify these reads with CLARK.
#   - Classify these reads with DIAMOND (in case of SE reads).
#   - Ensemble the classification output into a CSV file.
#   - Improve classification with WEVOTE.
